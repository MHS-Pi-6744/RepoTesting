## This is a practice repository for learning how GitHub works.
If you are new to GitHub try modifying this code on your working computer, create commits, and then pull them into the remote. Don't worry about breaking the code, it's just for practice.
If you need help ask any of the experienced coders on the team.
Have fun!
